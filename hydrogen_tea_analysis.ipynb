    "- **Clean transportation** (fuel cells)\n",
    "- **Energy storage** (power-to-gas)\n",
    "- **Chemical Manufacturing**\n",
    "\n",
    "However, **96% of hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels via steam methane reforming (SMR)**, emitting ~830 million tonnes CO2 annually worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Carbon Black Opportunity\n",
    "\n",
    "Acetylene black is a **highly conductive carbon black** used in:\n",
    "- Lithium-ion batteries\n",
    "- Supercapacitors\n",
    "- Advanced electronics\n",
    "- Specialty coatings\n",
    "\n",
    "It commands **2-3x the price** of commodity carbon blacks used in tires.\n",
