    "**Production Capacity**\n",
    "- **Hydrogen:** 393.1 kg/hr (3,100 tonnes/year)\n",
    "- **Acetylene Black:** 824.6 kg/hr (6,500 tonnes/year)\n",
    "- **Capacity Factor:** 91.7%\n",
    "\n",
    "**Environmental Performance**\n",
    "- **CO2 Intensity:** 0.12 kg CO2eq/kg H2 (99.9% reduction vs. SMR)\n",
    "- **Water Intensity:** 0.6kg H2O/kg H2 (86.7% reduction vs. SMR)\n",
    "- **Energy Source:** Renewable electricity\n",
    "- **Feedstock Source:** Landfill methane that would otherwise be released to atmosphere\n",
    "\n",
    "**Economic Advantages:**\n",
    "- Strong profitability with conservative pricing\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Hydrogen Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Hydrogen is critical for:\n",
    "- **Industrial decarbonization** (ammonia, steel, refining)\n",
    "- **Clean transportation** (fuel cells)\n",
    "- **Energy storage** (power-to-gas)\n",
    "- **Chemical Manufacturing**\n",
    "\n",
    "However, **96% of hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels via steam methane reforming (SMR)**, emitting ~845 million tonnes CO2 annually worldwide (9-10kg CO2 per kg H2).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Carbon Black Opportunity\n",
    "\n",
    "Acetylene black is a **highly conductive carbon black** used in:\n",
    "- Lithium-ion batteries\n",
    "- Supercapacitors\n",
    "- Advanced electronics\n",
    "- Specialty coatings\n",
    "\n",
    "It commands **2-3x the price** of commodity carbon blacks used in tires.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: Microwave Plasma Conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Reaction:** CH4 &rarr; C(s) + 2H2\n",
    "\n",
    "Using **microwave-induced plasma at 2000C** we crack methane into:\n",
    "- **Hydrogen gas** (99.9% purity after separation)\n",
    "- **Acetylene black** (premium conductive solid carbon)\n",
    "\n",
    "This process:\n",
    "- Eliminates CO2 emissions  (when using renewable electricity)\n",
    "- Minimizes water consumption (87% less than industry standard SMR)\n",
    "- Produces valuable co-product with downstream tech applications\n",
    "- Uses renewable natural gas feedstock that would otherwise contribute to global emissions\n",
